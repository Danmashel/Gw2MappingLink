Gw2Connection (Web receiver)
==============

Gw2Connection is an early alpha hosted front end for the Gw2MappingLink program. This receives the location data from the game and plots it on a map. Other features were added.
This is in no way a complete solution. It was up and running and worked as a good proof of concept. 

YMMV
